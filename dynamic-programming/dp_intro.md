# Dynamic Programming - Introduction

## Overview

Dynamic Programming (DP) is an optimization technique for solving problems by breaking them into overlapping subproblems and storing results to avoid recomputation.

## Key Concepts

1. **Overlapping Subproblems**: Same subproblems solved multiple times
2. **Optimal Substructure**: Optimal solution contains optimal solutions to subproblems
3. **Memoization**: Top-down approach (recursion + caching)
4. **Tabulation**: Bottom-up approach (iterative, table-filling)

## When to Use DP

- Optimization problems (min, max, count)
- Problems with overlapping subproblems
- Problems with optimal substructure
- Can be solved recursively but inefficient

## Common Patterns

1. **1D DP**: Fibonacci, climbing stairs, house robber
2. **2D DP**: Grid problems, longest common subsequence
3. **Knapsack**: 0/1 knapsack, unbounded knapsack
4. **String DP**: Edit distance, longest palindromic subsequence

## Learning Path (Future)

After completing the 30-day course, focus on:
- Day 1: Fibonacci, Climbing Stairs, House Robber
- Day 2: Coin Change, Longest Increasing Subsequence
- Day 3: Longest Common Subsequence, Edit Distance
- Day 4: 0/1 Knapsack, Partition Equal Subset Sum
- Day 5: Word Break, Palindrome Partitioning
