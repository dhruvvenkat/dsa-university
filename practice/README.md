# Practice Problems Log

Use this folder to track your practice problems and solutions.

## Structure

Create files for each topic as you progress:
- `arrays_practice.py`
- `linked_lists_practice.py`
- `stacks_queues_practice.py`
- etc.

## Problem Log Template

For each problem you solve, document:
1. Problem name and description
2. Approach used
3. Time/space complexity
4. Key insights
5. Edge cases considered

## Tips

- Don't just solve problems - understand the patterns
- Revisit problems after a few days
- Try multiple approaches
- Focus on clarity and correctness first, optimization later

## Progress Tracking

Keep track of:
- Problems solved per topic
- Time taken per problem
- Concepts that need more practice
- Patterns identified

**Remember**: The goal is deep understanding, not just solving problems. Take time to reflect on each solution!
